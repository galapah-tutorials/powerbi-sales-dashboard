PowerBI advanced data import tricks

Part I: Data source switch
This solution enables switching easily between alternative data sources (directories).

Part II: Loading a complex CSV with an R script


The PowerBI template file (dashboard.pbit) does not contain data. The data is 
attached to the solution as a separate CSV file.

The table SourcePaths must be replaced with a new table pointing to the 
appropriate directories.
